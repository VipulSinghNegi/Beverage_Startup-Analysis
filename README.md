Project Overview -

The beverage industry in India is not only vast but also fiercely competitive, with consumers constantly seeking innovative products that align with their preferences and 
lifestyles. Understanding these dynamics, the marketing team of our startup embarked on a journey to gain deeper insights into consumer behavior and preferences, 
with the ultimate goal of enhancing brand awareness, capturing market share, and refining product development strategies.
To achieve this objective, the team conducted a comprehensive survey across 10 key cities in India, garnering valuable feedback from a substantial pool of 10,000 respondents. 
This data treasure trove was then entrusted to me, Peter Pandey, a marketing data analyst, to transform raw survey data into actionable insights that could steer strategic 
decisions and drive the growth trajectory of our beverage startup.
In my analysis, I delved into various aspects of consumer behavior, including preferences for purchase location, consumption motivations, and overall brand perception. 
Additionally, employing SQL queries, I extracted valuable demographic insights across diverse marketing channels, providing a holistic view of our target audience.
