Project Overview -

Energy is a beverage startup thats aiming to make its marks on a indian market, a few month ago they launched their energy drink
in 10 cities. As we all know that the beverage industry in India is not only vast but also fiercely competitive, with consumers constantly seeking innovative products that align with their preferences and 
lifestyles. Understanding these dynamics, the marketing team of our startup embarked on a journey to gain deeper insights into consumer behavior and preferences, 
with the ultimate goal of enhancing brand awareness, capturing market share, and refining product development strategies.
To achieve this objective, the team conducted a comprehensive survey across 10 key cities in India, garnering valuable feedback from a substantial pool of 10,000 respondents.

decisions and drive the growth trajectory of our beverage startup.

Additionally, employing SQL queries, I extracted valuable demographic insights across diverse marketing channels, providing a holistic view of our target audience.
